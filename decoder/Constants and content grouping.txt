Step 2: Determination of Group
The medcinid set needs to be divided into groups before presentation. In
this document, global constants for these groups begin with "G_" and are
defined in "MEDCIN Global Constants". The sequence of these groups for
presentation should be definable by the end user. An initial default for
this sequence is as follows:
1.      G_REASON (Chief complaint)
2.      G_REFERDX (Referred here)
3.      G_HPI (History of present illness)
4.      G_CURMED (Current medication)
5.      G_PAST_MED_HIST (Past medical history)
6.      G_PAST_THERAPY (Previous therapy)
7.      G_PER_HIST (Personal history)
8.      G_HIST (History)
9.      G_FAM_HIST (Family history)
10.     G_ROS (Review of systems)
11.     G_PHYSICAL (Physical findings)
12.     G_OBSERV (Objective)
13.     G_TESTS (Tests)
14.     G_PAST_TESTS (Previous tests)
15.     G_ASSESS (Assessment)
16.     G_TESTCON (Test conclusions)
17.     G_THERAPY (Therapy)
18.     G_ALLERGYS (Allergies)
19.     G_VACCINES (Vaccinations)
20.     G_EDUCATION (Counseling/Education)
21.     G_DISCUSS (Discussed)
22.     G_PLAN (Plan)
23.     G_NOTE (Notes)
24.     G_OTHER (Other)
25.     G_EVAL (Practice management)

The report.gpseq field is used to store the sequence number and should be
initialized with either the default sequence or user's preferred sequence,
if available. The field will be subsequently referenced in "Sequence Reports
for Presentation". The following alphabetically-sequenced bulleted items
explain the group determination rules.

.       Allergies (G_ALLERGYS): This group includes all findings with a
chart.prefix of PREFIX_ALERGY (allergy to) or PREFIX_ INTOLERANT (intolerant
to). In addition, some findings embody the concept of "allergy" in their
context. Obtain a search list for these findings using the search word
string, "ALLERGY" " (see "Searching for MEDCIN Terms: Word Search"); if the
Medcinid in question is in the resulting list, the finding should be placed
in this group.

.       Assessment (G_ASSESS): This group includes medcinid 35832
(assessment free text). Also included are findings which have a termtype of
TYPE_DX (diagnosis) but do not have a chart.prefix of PREFIX_HISTORY
(history of). Also included are all findings which have a chart.prefix of
PREFIX_PRIMARY (primary diagnosis) or PREFIX_SECOND (secondary diagnosis).

.       Chief complaint (G_REASON): This group includes medcinid 1718 (chief
complaint free text).

.       Counseling/Education (G_EDUCATION): This group includes findings
with a termtype of TYPE_RX (therapy) and a blank chart.prefix and an rxcode
of RX_PATED (counseling and education).

.       Current Medication (G_CURMED): This group includes findings with a
termtype of TYPE_RX (therapy) and a blank chart.prefix and an rxcode of
either RX_MED (non-narcotic medications) or RX_NARC (narcotic medications).

.       Discussed (G_DISCUSS): This group includes all findings with a
chart.prefix of PREFIX_DISCUS (discussion of) or PREFIX_DISCUSRISK
(discussion of risk of). Note that to avoid textual redundancy during
presentation, change chart.prefix of PREFIX_DISCUS to PREFIX_BLANK and
PREFIX_DISCUSRISK to PREFIX_RISKOF (risk of) after this group determination
is made.

.       Family History (G_FAM_HIST): This group includes all findings with a
chart.prefix of PREFIX_FAMILY (family history of). In addition, some
findings embody the concept of "family history" in their context. Obtain a
search list for these findings using the search word string, "FAMILY
HISTORY" (see "Searching for MEDCIN Terms: Word Search"); if the medcinid in
question is in the resulting list, the finding should be placed in this
group.

.       History of Present Illness (G_HPI): This group includes all findings
with a termtype of TYPE_SYM (symptoms) and chart.prefix other than
PREFIX_HISTORY (history of) which have not been flagged as "review of
systems" findings during data entry.
Symptoms can belong to either G_HPI or G_ROS groups. The group determination
is made during data entry based on the type of encounter. In an encounter
where the patient has a presenting illness, patient related symptoms are
considered to be history of present illness. Where the patient is presenting
no illness (i.e. annual physical, routine checkup, etc.), the symptoms
entered during the encounter would be considered to be a review of systems.
The data entry program should have a mechanism that allows this
determination.

.       Notes (G_NOTE): This group includes medcinid 44460 (therapy free
text).

.       Objective (G_OBSERV): This group includes medcinid 11454 (objective
free text).

.       Other (G_OTHER): This group includes any finding not captured by any
of the other determinations.

.       Past Medical History (G_PAST_MED_HIST): This group includes findings
with a termtype of either TYPE_SYM (symptoms) or TYPE_PHY (physical exam)
findings and a chart.prefix of PREFIX_HISTORY. Also include any finding with
a termtype of TYPE_DX not captured elsewhere.

.       Personal History (G_PER_HIST): This group includes findings with a
termtype of TYPE_HIST (history) not captured elsewhere.

.       Physical findings (G_PHYSICAL): This group includes all findings
with a termtype of TYPE_PHY and a chart.prefix of other than PREFIX_HISTORY.

.       Plan (G_PLAN): This group includes all findings with a chart.prefix
of PREFIX_FOLLOWUP (follow-up for). It also includes medcinid 19467 (plan
free text) and medcinid 80566 (implementation specific system-generated care
plan text). It also includes all findings with a termtype of TYPE_TEST
(tests) or TYPE_RX (therapy) and have a chart.prefix of PREFIX_EVALUATE
(evaluate preoperatively for), PREFIX_ORDER (ordered), PREFIX_SCHEDULE
(scheduled for), PREFIX_REFERELS (referred elsewhere for), PREFIX_RULEOUT
(rule out).

.       Practice Management (G_EVAL): This group includes medcinid 48277
(visit status), as well as findings which are its children. One method is to
obtain the property record for 48277 and save its nodekey for comparison
purposes. Also include medcinids 44693 (evaluation & management services
free text) and 46015 (patient information sheets for recording purposes).

.       Previous tests (G_PAST_TESTS): This group includes findings with a
termtype of TYPE_TESTS not captured elsewhere.

.       Previous therapy (G_PAST_THERAPY): This group includes findings with
a termtype of TYPE_RX not captured elsewhere. Note that you may wish to
combine this group with Past Medical History.

.       Referred here (G_REFERDX): This group includes all findings which
have a chart.prefix of PREFIX_REFERDX (referral diagnosis of).

.       Review of Systems (G_ROS): This group includes all findings with a
termtype of TYPE_SYM (symptoms) and chart.prefix other than PREFIX_HISTORY
which have been flagged as "review of systems" findings during data entry.
See note above for History of Present Illness.

.       Subjective (G_HIST): This group includes medcinid 4415 (subjective
free text).

.       Test conclusions (G_TESTCON): This group includes all findings
within the range of medcinids 29005 through 29014 with a termtype of
TYPE_TEST and chart.onset is either null or within one day of the
chart.entrydate.

.       Tests (G_TESTS): This group includes all findings with a termtype of
TYPE_ TEST and chart.onset is either null or within one day of the
chart.entrydate, and are not classifiable as group G_TESTCON.

.       Therapy (G_THERAPY): This group includes findings with a termtype of
TYPE_RX (therapy) and a blank chart.prefix and an rxcode which is not
RX_VACC (vaccines), RX_PATED (counsling and education), RX_MED (non-narcotic
medication), or RX_NARC (narcotic medication). Also include findings with a
termtype of TYPE_RX (therapy) and chart.onset is either null or within one
day of the chart.entrydate.

.       Vaccinations (G_VACCINES): This group includes findings with a
termtype of TYPE_RX (therapy) and a blank chart.prefix and an rxcode of
RX_VACC (vaccines).
