A small amount of lubricant was applied to the glans and the bell-shaped plunger was placed over the glans covering the entire glans. The shaft skin below the corona remained relaxed and supple. The plate of the clamp was applied at the level of the corona. Once in proper alignment the clamp is tightened and a circumferential incision was made with a cold knife. The clamp was left in place for 5 minutes to allow for clotting and coagulation to occur. The clamp was then removed and antiseptic ointment was placed at the crush line. Good cosmesis and hemostasis was obtained.~ ~-Mogen Technique~The dorsal tip of the foreskin is grasped with a fine hemostat for traction, and another fine hemostat is used to open the plane between the glans and the foreskin back to the corona. The first hemostat is removed and replaced on the dorsal midline with its tip about 3 mm short of the corona, and locked in place. The Mogen clamp is opened fully and was pre-operatively checked to insure that the opening is no more than 3.0 mm. To ensure safe placement of the Mogen clamp, the glans was backed out of the way. The Mogen clamp is then slid across the foreskin from dorsal to ventral, following along the same angle as the corona with the hollow side of the clamp facing the glans. Before locking the Mogen clamp shut, the glans was manipulated to be sure it is free of the clamp's jaws. Once the Mogen clamp is locked, the foreskin is excised flush with the flat surface of the clamp with a 10-blade scalpel. The clamp is left on for a few moments to insure hemostasis, then unlocked and removed. The crush line covers the glans fully with penile shaft skin. The glans is then liberated by thumb traction at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions that pulls the crush line apart. Good cosmesis and hemostasis was obtained."
