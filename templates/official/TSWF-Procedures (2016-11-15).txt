Good cosmesis and hemostasis was obtained.~ ~-Mogen Technique~The dorsal tip of the foreskin is grasped with a fine hemostat for traction, and another fine hemostat is used to open the plane between the glans and the foreskin back to the corona. The first hemostat is removed and replaced on the dorsal midline with its tip about 3 mm short of the corona, and locked in place. The Mogen clamp is opened fully and was pre-operatively checked to insure that the opening is no more than 3.0 mm. To ensure safe placement of the Mogen clamp, the glans was backed out of the way. The Mogen clamp is then slid across the foreskin from dorsal to ventral, following along the same angle as the corona with the hollow side of the clamp facing the glans. Before locking the Mogen clamp shut, the glans was manipulated to be sure it is free of the clamp jaws. Once the Mogen clamp is locked, the foreskin is excised flush with the flat surface of the clamp with a 10-blade scalpel. The clamp is left on for a few moments to insure hemostasis, then unlocked and removed. The crush line covers the glans fully with penile shaft skin. The glans is then liberated by thumb traction at the 3 and 9 oclock positions that pulls the crush line apart. Good cosmesis and hemostasis was obtained.~.........."
