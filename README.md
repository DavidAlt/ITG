**I**llegitimate **T**emplate **G**enerator for AHLTA

This project was conceived as a way to develop AHLTA Form Templates without the official GUI designer. Although partially functional, development has stopped due to my own time and coding limitations. 

For anyone interested in a deeper understanding of AHLTA's form templates, I encourage you to look at [this file](https://github.com/DavidAlt/ITG/blob/master/Master%20Decoder.docx), which contains my accumulated knowledge on the topic.
